# Battlefield-ish respawn
A mod for Gmod that allows you to select one of the spawnpoints on a map

(c) ConorSNES 2023

## Description
When a player dies, they can select a spawnpoint on a visual map popup. Upon respawning, they respawn at the selected point.
This mod is designated for use in sandbox/sandbox derived only as use in others is unstable (may cause bugs). 
The mod will automatically break execution if the gamemode is not sandbox.

## Known issues
- Addon is nonfunctional on gamemodes other than sandbox
	- This is as it is due to unpredictible hook structuring
- Addon is compatible with only up to 255 spawnlocation/s
	- It is unlikely there is more than 255, but if this needs changing, raise an issue

## Possible future features
- Translation support
- Select anywhere as a spawnpoint
